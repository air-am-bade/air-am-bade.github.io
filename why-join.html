      <h3>As a graduate buddy</h3>
      <p>Gain a connection with people who truly understand and can relate to you.</p>
      <p>Receive objective, unbiased advice on navigating your PhD journey.</p>
      <p>Learn from the firsthand experience of someone who has already navigated through their PhD and explored life after it.</p>

    <!-- Post-Graduate Buddy Section -->
    <div class="buddy-box">
      <img src="postBuddy.png" alt="Post-graduate buddy icon" class="buddy-icon" />
      <h3>As a post-graduate buddy</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wished you could go back to your first-year PhD self and share your hard-earned advice with them? While going back in time is not an option (yet), this is your chance to make a meaningful impact on someone else’s PhD journey.</p>
      <p>Gain a new perspective on your own experiences, and you might find out that all the highs and the lows of your journey can be useful lessons to share.</p>
      <p>Build new connections and start creating a healthier research culture.</p>
