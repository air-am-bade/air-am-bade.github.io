        <h3>As a Graduate Buddy</h3>
        <p>Gain a connection with people who truly understand and can relate to you.</p>
        <p>Receive objective, unbiased advice on navigating your PhD journey.</p>
        <p>Learn from the firsthand experience of someone who has already completed their PhD and explored life after it.</p>

        <h3>As a Post-Graduate Buddy</h3>
        <p>Have you ever wished you could go back to your first-year PhD self and share your hard-earned advice with them? While going back in time isn’t possible (yet), this is your chance to make a meaningful impact on someone else’s PhD journey.</p>
        <p>Gain a new perspective on your own experiences — you might find that all the highs and lows of your journey can become valuable lessons to share.</p>
        <p>Build new connections and help create a kinder, healthier research culture.</p>

      <em><strong>PhD<em>buddy</em></strong> is about community, empathy, and making the PhD experience kinder for everyone.</em>
