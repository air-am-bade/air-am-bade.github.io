    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <ul class="how-list">
      <li>We match PhD students with post-graduates from similar fields and backgrounds.</li>
      <li>After you sign up, three post-graduate buddies are made available for you to connect with – you can get to know all of them and have conversations with whoever you choose or is available.</li>
      <li>We define the structure of the conversation together based on your needs and goals.</li>
      <li>We have open conversations with you about the non-academic, social, organizational, and mental challenges of your PhD journey.</li>
      <li>The conversations can happen as often as the graduate and post-graduate buddies agree on.</li>
      <li>We are not medical professionals; therefore we are in no position to provide solutions about your personal journeys, but we are open to listening, sharing our experiences, and offering new perspectives.</li>
      <li>These conversations will be confidential.</li>
    </ul>
