    <h1>Supporting Mental Health on your PhD Journey</h1>
    <p>We connect current PhD students with PhD graduates who have walked a similar path.</p>
    <p>Through listening and sharing, we aim to give you a platform that makes your PhD journey less isolating and more empowering.</p>
    <p>We aspire to provide unbiased companionship because we share similar experiences with you.</p>
    <p>We want to hold empathetic space for you as you navigate challenges during your PhD - regardless of your academic course.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 3em;">
  <em>We believe that shared experience is a powerful form of support and healing.</em>
