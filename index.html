        <h1>Supporting Mental Health on your PhD Journey</h1>
        <p>We connect current PhD students with PhD graduates who have walked a similar path.</p>
        <p>Through listening and sharing, we aim to give you a platform that makes your PhD journey less isolating and more empowering.</p>
        <p>We aspire to provide unbiased companionship because we share similar experiences with you.</p>
        <p>We want to hold empathetic space for you as you navigate challenges during your PhD – regardless of your academic course.</p>
        <p class="final-line"><em><strong>We believe that shared experience is a powerful form of support and healing.</strong></em></p>

          <h3>As a Post-Graduate Buddy</h3>
          <p>Have you ever wished you could go back to your first-year PhD self and share your hard-earned advice with them? While going back in time isn’t possible (yet), this is your chance to make a meaningful impact on someone else’s PhD journey.</p>
          <p>Gain a new perspective on your own experiences — you might find that all the highs and lows of your journey can become valuable lessons to share.</p>
          <p>Build new connections and help create a kinder, healthier research culture.</p>
