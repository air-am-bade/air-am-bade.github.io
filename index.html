          <h3>How It Works</h3>
          <p>We match PhD students with post-graduates from similar fields and backgrounds.</p>
          <p>After you sign up, three post-graduate buddies are made available for you to connect with – you can get to know all of them and have conversations with whoever you choose or is available.</p>
          <p>We define the structure of the conversation together based on your needs and goals.</p>
          <p>We have open conversations with you about the non-academic, social, organizational, and mental challenges of your PhD journey.</p>
          <p>The conversations can happen as often as the graduate and post-graduate buddies agree on.</p>
          <p>We are not medical professionals; therefore, we are in no position to provide solutions about your personal journeys, but we are open to listening, sharing our experiences, and offering new perspectives.</p>
          <p>These conversations will be confidential.</p>
